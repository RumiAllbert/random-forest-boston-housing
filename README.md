# Boston Housing Price Prediction with Random Forest

### About
This example demonstrates how to use the [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) algorithm to predict the price of a house in Boston. The dataset is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

In this notebook, I used Random Forest and GridSearch to create the 'best' model. I also used the [Mean Absolute Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) to evaluate the model. By no means, is the model presented here the best model for this dataset. It is just a demonstration of how to use Random Forest. 

### Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset contains 506 samples and 13 features. The features are the average number of rooms per dwelling, average number of non-retail business acres per town, pupil-teacher ratio by town, and so on. The target is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
